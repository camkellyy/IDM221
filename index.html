        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I am currently a Pre-Junior at Drexel University. I am working towards my major in User Experience and Interaction Design with a minor in Computer Science as well as Human Computer Interaction. The combination of the technical and the creative, which is quite unique, is what drew me to my major. I enjoy the coding side of UXID because of its puzzle-like nature, as well as the logic and structure that comes with it. I also find an ease of expression through the design and creativity of my major.</p>
